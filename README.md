Tech stack used in this project:

- Expo (God bless the team there)
- Formik (handling forms inputs)
- Firebase (for authentication)
- React native
- Typescript

Please feel free to do with it whatever you will. MIT license and all of that. if you kinda like it a star could go a long way.

##How to use

- Fork it and then you can replace your firebase credentials to the one in the config.js file located in the authentication folder.
- To change the texts,check the config file as well and change, text, background-color and image.
